In Part 1, we are to create a Python script to analyze the financlial records of our company. We were given data to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

In Part 2, we are to create a Python script to help a small, rural town modenize its vote-counting process.

- Winner of the election based on popular vote

I had help from one of my friends for the code in PyBank on the "for row in csvreader:" down to the end of the section. I also used Chat GPT and the Xpert Learning Assistant for other parts of code/troubleshooting code. The internet and classmates/friends are valuable resources that helped me complete this Module.
